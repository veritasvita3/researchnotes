## in trans

In trans (Latin for "on the other side") means the information is used from a separate, distinct molecule. The repair template is physically disconnected from the broken DNA.

The opposite would be in cis ("on the same side"), where the information is used from the same molecule. This is impossible for a DSB because the information on both sides of the break is destroyed.

How it works in HR:
The cell cannot use the broken chromosome itself as a template. Instead, it must access a different, undamaged DNA molecule that carries the same genetic information. In somatic cells, this is almost always the sister chromatid (an identical copy produced during DNA replication). During meiosis, it can also be the homologous chromosome (from the other parent).
