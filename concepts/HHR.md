## Homologous Recombination

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic lesions that can lead to cell death or genomic rearrangements like cancer if not repaired correctly. Homologous recombination (HR) is a high-fidelity repair pathway that uses an undamaged, homologous DNA sequence (typically the sister chromatid) as a template to accurately restore the broken DNA.

The core principle of HR is to access and copy genetic information [in trans](concepts\copy_in_trans.md). This process is elegantly orchestrated, involving numerous proteins that form dynamic, often reversible, intermediates to ensure repair accuracy and minimize harmful outcomes like loss of heterozygosity (LOH).

HR is, at its heart, a copying mechanism. It does not simply glue the broken ends back together. Instead, it uses the existing genetic information as a blueprint to re-synthesize the missing DNA sequence. This is why HR is error-free (high-fidelity); it replicates the information exactly as it was before the break.

Contrast with NHEJ: Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a "cut-and-paste" mechanism. It ligates the broken ends directly, often resulting in small deletions or insertions at the junction site. It does not copy lost information; it just seals the break, potentially with errors.
