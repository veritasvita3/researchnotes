Immune infiltration

Immune infiltration refers to the presence and abundance of immune cells inside a tumor (within the tumor microenvironment, TME).

When cancer develops, immune cells from the body (like T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, etc.) can migrate into the tumor tissue. This process is called infiltration.

Why it matters

Anti-tumor immunity:

Some immune cells (e.g., CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, NK cells) can recognize and kill cancer cells. High infiltration of these is often a good sign.

Pro-tumor effects:

Other immune cells (e.g., tumor-associated macrophages, regulatory T cells) can suppress the immune response or promote tumor growth. High infiltration of these may be bad for prognosis.

Cancer immunotherapy:

Many treatments (like checkpoint inhibitors: anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA4) depend on whether immune cells have infiltrated the tumor. Tumors with little infiltration are called “cold tumors”, which often respond poorly to immunotherapy. Tumors with strong infiltration are “hot tumors”, usually more responsive.

How it’s measured

Pathology: Counting immune cells on stained tumor slides (immunohistochemistry).

Flow cytometry: Direct measurement of immune cell populations from tumor tissue.

RNA-seq deconvolution (like TIMER2.0): Uses bulk tumor transcriptomic data (TCGA) to estimate proportions of immune cells computationally. That’s what your TIMER heatmap is showing.
