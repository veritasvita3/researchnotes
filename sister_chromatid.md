## Sister Chromatids

Sister chromatids are two identical, replicated strands of a single chromosome that remain connected at a central region called the centromere, forming an "X" shape during cell division. They are produced when a chromosome duplicates itself during the S phase of the cell cycle, and their connection and separation are essential for accurately distributing genetic material into daughter cells during mitosis and meiosis.  

How they form:

DNA Replication: During the S phase of the cell cycle, the cell's DNA is copied. 
Identical Copies: This replication process creates two identical DNA molecules. 
Joined at the Centromere: These identical copies, now called sister chromatids, remain attached to each other at a region called the centromere.
